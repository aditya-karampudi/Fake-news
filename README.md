# Fake-news
## “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” – Winston Churchill

Since the 2016 presidential election, one topic dominating political discourse is the issue of “Fake News”. A number of political pundits claim that the rise of  significantly biased and/or untrue news influenced the election, though a study by researchers from Stanford and New York University concluded otherwise. Nonetheless, fake news posts have exploited Facebook users’ feeds to propagate throughout the internet.

### What is Fake News
Obviously, a deliberately misleading story is “fake news” but lately blathering social media discourse,  is changing its definition. Some now use the term to dismiss facts counter to their preferred viewpoints, the most prominent example being President Trump. Such a vaguely-defined term is ripe for a cynical manipulation.

I assembled a dataset of fake and real news and employed a Naive Bayes classifier in order to create a model to classify an article as fake or real based on its words and phrases.


This repository consists of data taken from kaggle about fake news that prevailed at the time of U.S election 2016
The data consists two columns 
1. Headline of article
2. Body of article.

Classifying “fake news” provides a novel challenge to the data science community.  In many machine learning projects, the distinction between the different classes you want to predict is clear, whereas it’s a lot murkier in this case. This project validates the notion in data science that intuition and intimacy with your data is just as or more important than any model or tool at your disposal.
